<p>My career journey began on a different path, where I developed valuable skills and gained extensive experience. Working in the FMCG sector with Nestl√© gave me a solid foundation in strategic planning, problem-solving, and effective communication.</p>

<p>However, I discovered a deep interest in technology and programming, which led me to transition into software development. My fascination with the field's innovation and dynamism sparked this transition. The opportunity to create impactful solutions that enhance people's lives and foster progress in multiple sectors motivated me to broaden my skills.</p>

<p>I have experience with programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and C#. Additionally, I am embracing the dynamic world of web technologies, focusing on full-stack development. My technical skills include Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, PHP, Node.js, and MongoDB.</p>

<p>I am also exploring the exciting field of Artificial Intelligence, learning to integrate AI models into web applications to create more intelligent and responsive solutions.</p>

<p>Recently, I have been working on Large Language Models to develop a custom chatbot using GPT technology for my portfolio website, enhancing user interaction and providing advanced conversational capabilities.</p>
